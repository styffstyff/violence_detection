# violence detection w/ computer vision 

## Why
I am working on this project as my *TIPE* for the french *"Concours aux grandes écoles d'ingénieur"*.  
The aim of the project is to suggest an algorithm able to detect violent behaviors.  

## Requirements
The video input must have a fixed background with the least as possible moving objects (except pedestrians).  
The detection is based on motion detection with background substraction.  
In order to track people I am using a kalman filter.  
The algorithm is not able to detect dangereous behaviors yet.
